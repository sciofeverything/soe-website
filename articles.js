text2: " In the beginning of a rocket‚Äôs launch, its engine undergoes the process of combustion, which is a process where fuel is burned to produce lots of energy. This combustion process releases immense amounts of exhaust gas that has an enormous weight. The exhaust‚Äôs weight is a force from the rocket on the ground below it. Thus according to newton‚Äôs third law, the ground pushes up the rocket with the same weight that was exerted by the exhaust gas. This reaction force is called thrust. The ground is so big that the large weight of the exhaust has a negligible effect on the ground, but considering the fact that the rocket‚Äôs mass is much smaller than earth, the thrust acting on the rocket is enough to make it launch with great speed." ,
text3: " Now that the rocket has successfully initiated its motion off the ground, it needs to take the simplest, fastest, and easiest way which uses as little fuel as possible to get into orbit around earth. A rocket can hardly get into earth‚Äôs orbit by going straight up. But to achieve this goal, a rocket must initially launch with a certain small angle, such that when it starts its motion upwards, gravity effects it forming a slight curve in the path the rocket takes. You can think of it as similar to the parabolic shape formed by projectile motion. This curve grows larger as the rocket attains a higher speed and gets further away from earth, so that once it arrives at the desired orbit position, it will have tilted as much as it needs to successfully orbit earth.",
text4: " But what is an orbit? Its the curved path around a planet, moon, or sun. It is positioned at a place where the earth‚Äôs gravitational force is equal to the force caused by the rocket‚Äôs constant rotation that allows it to follow a curved path. When these two forces are equal, their net force is zero, so according to newton‚Äôs second law, the rocket can‚Äôt fall back to earth, but it stays in its orbit.",
text5: " Aside from that, we want to question: why do we send rockets into orbit anyways? Rockets are launched for several different reasons, two of those reasons are to to send satellites into orbit, and to send space shuttles and astronauts. Many believe that rockets can‚Äôt move in space, or vacuum - where there is no air. Actually they can, because the principle upon which rockets were built depends on newtons third law and the presence of forces, not air. Indeed this point particularly is what differs a rocket from an airplane: rockets don‚Äôt depend on air and can move in vacuum, whereas airplanes depend on air and need oxygen to fuel and fly. That‚Äôs because the oxygen needed to complete combustion in a rocket is already packed and put inside it, whereas an airplane takes the oxygen it needs from the air around it. What we‚Äôve so far discussed applies mostly to rockets used to get to space. But rockets can be used in many other different fields, mainly using the same principle of newton‚Äôs third law to launch them. Some of these fields include weaponry and fireworks.",

  text: "Many people, maybe you included, are fascinated by space rockets and their ability to fly out of our beloved planet earth. These huge flying vehicles have only been around for not so long. The first launch was about 70 years ago. But how do rockets launch? And why do they take a certain curved trajectory?"

text2: "To begin, surface tension is an effect of cohesive forces of the liquid‚Äôs molecules, which form a thin elastic-like sheet or net on the liquid‚Äôs surface. But what are cohesive forces? They are the intermolecular attractive forces between molecules of the same type. Cohesive forces are responsible for keeping the liquid together. Inside the liquid, a molecule has cohesive forces acting 360 degrees around it, pulling it to all sides equally; but when it comes to molecules on the surface of a liquid, the forces are only present on one side, and the other side is air, so they are only pulled to one side. Thus these molecules near the surface are bound tighter than others, and they are not as easy to pull away.",
text3: "This greater attraction creates some kind of net or sheet on the surface of a liquid. Also, this justifies why liquids take the smallest surface area possible; the attraction forces make the liquid molecules come close together as much as possible, and as a result, lets the liquid take the smallest surface area it can take - this is why droplets are spherical; spheres have the smallest surface area of all shapes." ,
text4: "To demonstrate the fact that molecules of a liquid are bound together and that they tend to occupy the smallest surface area, watch the video of astronaut Chris Hadfield (find the link at the end), where while in space, he soaks a towel in water and then squeezes it to observe how the water acts without gravity. Pretty fascinating, isn‚Äôt it üëÄ?",
text5: "For those interested about the formula for surface tension: generally, surface tension is described as gamma equals to the force divided by the length of contact. Liquids usually hold up an object on their surface when the object‚Äôs weight is equal to the force from surface tension. This explains how insects can sit on water and not sink üêù .",

text2: "Needed: Paper, wide plate, water, soap, and a cotton bud. Procedure: Pour water into the plate, then place the squished paper, or if you prefer, a paper boat on its surface. Now put some soap on the cotton, and touch the surface of water close to the paper with the cotton bud. Observation: The paper will move away from the cotton bud. That‚Äôs because soap reduces the surface tension of water. As a result, the water molecules tend to move to the area with higher surface tension - recall that the higher the surface tension is stronger the attraction forces between molecules.",

text4: "Needed: Water in a glass, a cotton bud, soap, and light metal like a staple or the spring in clicking pens. Procedure: Slowly and carefully, balance the piece of metal on the surface of water. Afterwards, stir the water with the soap-holding cotton bud. Keep adding soap to the cotton and repeat until you observe the piece of metal suddenly sinking to the bottom of the glass, like metals usually do. Observation: when a metal is carefully balanced on the surface of water, its weight and the force of surface tension are equal. But when soap is added, the surface tension of water decreases, reducing the force of surface tension. As a result, the metal‚Äôs weight dominates the motion and drags the metal to sink.",
text5: "3. water against gravity:",
text6: "Needed: A water bottle with a hole in its cap, a glass, a paper Procedure: Secure the water-filled bottle with its holed cap and place the paper on top of it. Flip the water bottle upside down and gradually remove the paper side-ways. You‚Äôll observe that the water doesn‚Äôt spill. That‚Äôs because surface tension holds the water molecules close together. Keep in mind that once the system is disturbed, even with a light squeeze, the water may spill.",

videoText: "Angular Momentum Derivation",
text2: "Let‚Äôs get back to the start. When the Earth starts to heat up, big glaciers melt causing a rise in sea levels (as the water from the melted ice redistributes itself across the oceans). Here is where the physics of the situation comes in. First, let me briefly explain angular momentum. It is similar to linear momentum, but instead of being for objects moving linearly, it is for rotating objects. To elaborate, they‚Äôre both (angular and linear) derived from the concept of momentum, which can be defined as the quantity of motion an object has. So angular momentum is the quantity of motion a rotating object has. It‚Äôs formula is: L = I x W. Where L is the angular momentum; I is the moment of inertia of an object; W is the object‚Äôs angular speed (like linear speed v, but for rotating objects. It depends on the angle difference rather than the distance difference).  For those unfamiliar with moment of inertia: it is the rotating object‚Äôs resistance to rotational motion. Its general formula is: mr^2 (it differs from one shape to another), where m is the mass and r is the object‚Äôs radius or length (measured from its rotational axis).",
text3: "Returning to our main topic, when sea levels rise, so does Earth‚Äôs radius (slightly). This change in radius changes the moment of inertia of Earth, which in return, also changes the angular momentum of Earth (as discussed earlier: angular momentum depends on the moment of inertia, which depends on the radius).",
text4: "But angular momentum cannot change; it is a conserved quantity as long as their are no net forces acting on the body (which are not present on Earth). So, instead of changing the angular momentum of earth - which can‚Äôt happen - the angular speed of earth changes, so that the total product of angular momentum and angular speed is conserved. Because the moment of inertia is increasing (slightly) due to increasing radius, the angular speed must decrease (slightly).",
text5: "Of course, many other consequences follow this phenomena, one of which is the lengthening of an earth day by a couple of milliseconds. Though this whole change is so small for us to even realize, it is still an important matter in terms of climate change effects. It shows how the effects of climate change go beyond what we have ever imagined." ,

  text: "It may seem contradictory: how and why would Earth‚Äôs rotation slow down? what is even more surprising is the fact that this effect results from human activities which cause global warming and climate change - yet another reason to stop warming the planet."

text2: "We also know that earth rotates with a certain velocity; the angular velocity being constant, while the linear velocity is not. The linear velocity of earth at the equator is greater than that at the poles, that is because the equator‚Äôs radius is larger than that of the poles. To explain: angular velocity is constant everywhere on earth, and its equation is v (linear velocity) divided by R (radius); the angular velocity must remain constant as the radius changes at different latitudes (vertical points/heights on earth), thus the linear velocity must change to acclimate with the change in radius. At the poles the radius is small -> decreased linear velocity, at the equator the radius is large -> large linear velocity.",
text3: "Let‚Äôs take an object, a missile for example, and assume that it‚Äôs fired from the equator towards the northern hemisphere. Once it‚Äôs fired, it will have attained the rightward linear velocity of the equator (the direction of earth‚Äôs rotation), as it was rotating with the same linear velocity of the point it lies on just before the launch. As the missile goes north, it flies over regions on earth with lower linear velocity (as they have smaller radii) than the equator; but over these points, the missile still holds the velocity of its firing point, that is faster than the rotation of the ground below it at further latitudes. As a result, the missile appears to be turning to the right when over these grounds due to the excess eastward velocity it holds. Thus when the missile lands, it will have a certain displacement to the right from where it was supposed to land otherwise. This effect is known as the Coriolis effect.",
text4: "To counteract this deflection, scientists presented the term Coriolis force so that it is calculated within the equations of objects flying over large distances in either the southern or northern hemisphere; without adding it in the Newtonian laws of motion, these objects, such as planes, are prone to getting deflected out of their desired path. The direction of the deflection caused by the Coriolis effect reverses its direction in the northern and southern hemispheres; where objects moving towards the north appear to deflect rightwards, and objects going towards the south deflect leftwards. This is because when looking to the south from the perspective of objects moving towards it, earth seems to rotate to the west (left); while when looking to the north from the perspective of an object moving towards it, earth seems to rotate to the east (right). Another way to think of it is that, when one imagines themselves standing on the South Pole and looking down, earth appears to be rotating clockwise, while it appears to be rotating counterclockwise when looking down from the North Pole.",
text5: "What about objects moving east-west on the equator? The Coriolis effect on them is simply zero because the latitude is zero.",
text6: "Thanks to the scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, who discovered the Coriolis effect back in 1835; his contributions vastly expanded our knowledge about earth‚Äôs nature.",

  text: "Coriolis effect: an effect that most of us usually neglect thinking of, yet is crucial to several sciences, including oceanology, geology, and aerodynamics. The Coriolis effect is due to the Coriolis force, a fictitious force. To further clarify, a fictitious force is an ‚Äòimaginary‚Äô force in a non-inertial reference frame, meaning, the frame from which we observe the motion of an object from, is accelerating. In our example, the non-inertial reference frame is earth, as it is rotating to the east (counterclockwise) around its center - rotating objects are always accelerating to change direction and rotate. The fictitious force is present to balance out the acceleration of earth, and it effects objects moving over large distances in either hemispheres; whereas, if we were to observe the moving object from a stationary object in space, for example, the Coriolis effect will not be apparent, as our reference frame is inertial (I.e non-accelerating; stationary). So, we conclude that fictitious forces are present in all non-inertial reference frames. In the case of earth being the non-inertial frame, the Coriolis force is its fictitious force."

text2: "But that‚Äôs not what matters when analyzing why rubber bounces high. When you hold a rubber ball up high, it has gravitational potential energy; that energy starts transforming to kinetic energy once you release it. When the rubber reaches the ground, the potential energy is completely transformed to kinetic. Then, the rubber compresses to the ground, storing the kinetic energy internally as elastic potential energy (energy from the compression of rubber); as it decompresses, the internal energy is restored to kinetic energy which allows the ball to bounce again. Moreover, as the ball decompresses, the force the rubber gives off to itself to restore its original shape pushes the ground, and in return, the ground pushes it back giving it a boost upwards (newton‚Äôs 3rd law); this is an advantage that not many other materials behold.",
text3: "If some energy is lost as heat during the collision of the ball and the ground, the ball won‚Äôt reach its initial height, which commonly happens.",
text4: "Another factor justifying why rubber balls bounce high is the coefficient of restitution, the ratio of the velocity after and before the collision, or the square root of the height after and before the collision. If the coefficient is 1, the ball reaches the same height it was released from; if zero, the ball doesn‚Äôt bounce back at all. For a rubber super-ball, the coefficient is 0.9, meaning a rubber ball bounces to reach a height so close to its initial height; whereas steel‚Äôs coefficient is about 0.75.",
text5: "But what if it falls on something loose, like sand? In that case, the kinetic energy the ball attained while falling deforms the ball AND the ground. Meaning that it isn‚Äôt only transformed to internal energy in the ball, but much of it goes to the loose ground, resulting in a smaller amount of energy returning to the ball; thus it doesn‚Äôt bounce as high.",

While rubber is elastic, the ratio of its stress and strain is small compared to other materials, like steel - when applying the same force to rubber and steel, the rubber deforms more, compared to a micro deformation in steel, resulting in a smaller elasticity ratio for rubber.

When light is directed towards a smooth surface -metal for example- , all reflected light rays are reflected towards a single direction, which is the same direction of light‚Äôs incidence - according to the law of reflection. For that reason, all of the reflected light comes to our eyes when looking to that surface, and it makes a clear image of the reflection.",
text3: "On the contrary, when light is directed towards a rough surface -like paper or wood- , rays are not reflected in the same direction because of the unevenness of the surface, so you perceive only a fraction of the rays and thus barely see a reflection on the surface (in other words, the surface appears matte).",
text4: "Of course, the more rough the material, the less of the reflection we perceive; and the smoother the material, the clearer the reflection becomes. A common misconception is that matte surfaces don‚Äôt reflect light; the truth is that all objects we see around us reflect light, otherwise they are not visible; but the glossy appearance we perceive on an object depends on its roughness and how much of the reflected light comes to our eyes.",

But if the pan‚Äôs temperature is set to become even hotter, it can reach the Leidenfrost point. When you pour water on the pan at that temperature point, not all of it evaporates because of the heat, but instead, only the bottom part of the water evaporates into steam and forms a vapor layer beneath the rest of the water. This steam layer acts as an insulator between the remaining water and the hot pan. Eventually, the remaining water will evaporate too after the pan‚Äôs heat is conducted to the water (slowly) through the small steam layer. This process may take seconds, or even minutes, depending on the circumstances.",
text3: "The exact Leidenfrost point temperature varies greatly, as it depends on the pan‚Äôs material and amount of water poured.",

Imagine an inclined metal surface with sawtooth on it, demonstrated in the video linked at the end, and this surface is heated to Leidenfrost‚Äôs point. When a water droplet is dropped on the bottom end of this surface, steam is formed beneath it (as discussed above). The steam formed will move to the slide-like part of the sawtooth and will ‚Äòslide‚Äô over it. Recall that water follows the path of the steam, similar to a situation where you stand on a moving walkway and move with it. As a result, the water will ‚Äòslide‚Äô off the slide-like part of the sawtooth. This pattern continues as the steam drags the water up the inclined surface, and thus water goes uphill, until the droplet evaporates completely.",

Light scatters because of refraction, imagine it as when light goes from one medium to another (such as from air to water), it bends (think of a spoon inside a glass of water, it appears to be bent, right?). White light scattering is special, though: when it scatters, it gets divided to all its color components, which are all colors (I.e each color or wavelength will have its own direction, instead of all the colors being in one direction to form white light). An example of white light is sunlight, which is the basis of most of the natural occurring optical phenomena.",
text3: "After sunlight passes through the droplets, it is no longer white light that we see, but the colors of the rainbow. Rainbows take their circular shape because we can only see the light rays coming straight to our eyes from the droplet. However, what comes to our eyes doesn‚Äôt only come from one point, but rather an infinite number of points around us at a specific angle, which makes a circle of incoming light rays when we‚Äôre looking from the sky, and half a circle when looking from the ground (the ground acts as a barrier that doesn‚Äôt allow us to see the other half).",
text4: "But why do we see a rainbow in a specific place and not in another? Whenever we see a rainbow, the sun is directly behind us -this is the only way a rainbow is visible. Moreover, light exits the water droplets at an angle relative to its original path. More precisely, light deviates from its original path because of refraction and reflection inside the droplet it passes through (light bends when it enters another medium). The deviation angle differs from one color to another (depending on the wavelength); from blue having a smaller wavelength, producing a smaller angle, thus smaller circle, and red having a longer wavelength, producing a larger circle. All the other colors lie in between these two circles. The deviation angle is also the same angle you need to lift your head up with to see the rainbow ‚Äîi.e it is the only point in the sky where a rainbow can be seen. After all, light travels in all directions around its deviation angle when it exits the droplet, but the only light rays that matter are those that have a direction straight to our eyes from that angle.",

When the ice crystals within the clouds are oriented in the right position with respect to our eyes, they can cause sunlight ‚Äîor moonlight‚Äî to refract, scatter, & reflect, producing a colorful ‚Äîor not‚Äî ring around the sun that we can observe. This ring is often called a 22-degree halo because halos are most commonly seen at an angle of 22 degrees from the center from where you‚Äôre looking. When you observe a halo and then change your position, you can see a halo -too- but one that is produced by different ice crystals (ones that also make a 22-degree angle). Sometimes halos can be seen even when no cirrus clouds ‚Äòappear‚Äô; that‚Äôs because the clouds are so thin to be apparent. Halos are of many types, some of which are extremely rare, and some of which are common like the 22-degree halo.",

text5: "Opposing other optical phenomena, coronas are formed solely by diffraction (explained in the second image). Coronas are commonly mistaken with halos; however, they differ in the previously pointed out reason, and in size: halos are bigger in diameter than coronas. When water droplets cross the path of sunlight or moonlight, light diffracts around them. As a result of this diffraction, the white light divides into its colors. Coronas appear just around the sun or moon, and that‚Äôs because they occur due to the water droplets (or any small particle, really) standing in the way of the sunlight or moonlight‚Äôs path. Coronas are hardly seen in daylight because people tend to avoid looking at the sun at that time, but another yet simple way to see a corona is to see the lunar corona, the one occurring around the moon ‚Äîwhich is more visible (remember, however, that coronas don‚Äôt always appear; they‚Äôre rare).",

text2: "Let‚Äôs start by understanding how they form. There are 3 ways in which volcanoes can form: divergent plates, convergent plates, and hot spots. Volcano formation by divergent plates occur when two tectonic plates move apart, pushing the magma beneath them upwards filling the space between them. On the other hand, convergent plate formation is when two tectonic plates move towards each other, and one of them dives under the other. As the one under moves further down, high pressure and temperatures cause magma between the two plates to rise to the surface, gradually forming volcanoes. The third and last way, hot spots, is when hot spots, areas of high magmatic activity and tons of molten rocks, push their way up (from extreme heat & pressure) breaking through the tectonic plate above them to form volcanoes. As magma rises, changes in pressure can cause bubble formation inside it. If the magma is too thick for the bubbles to escape, the pressure may become too extreme that when magma reaches the surface (also known as lava) an explosion occurs - this is what differs an explosive volcano from a non explosive one.",
text3: "Volcanoes can be classified as either extinct or active. Extinct volcanoes have not had any sign of volcanic activity for more than 10,000 years, while active volcanoes are either erupting, or showing signs of volcanic activity and are expected to erupt again (dormant).",

text3: "1. One conductor is attached to another conductor at two junctions (an easy way of doing this is by bringing two finite wires -made of different materials- and connecting their ends together)",
text4: "2. One of these junctions is heated, while the other is cooled or left at room temperature.",
text5: "3. We can see how much voltage is generated between the two wires by using a voltmeter, which is usually a few milli volts -not much, but can be greater on a larger scale.",
text6: "4. we can use this voltage to make something that requires electricity work, like charging a phone (although charging a phone is difficult because the electricity is too little, perhaps something simpler is better, like lighting a small LED).",
text7: "This happens because: When heat is applied to one of the junctions, heated electrons flow toward the cooler junction through the two conductors to achieve thermal equilibrium, i.e balance of heat. But because each conductor has a different Seebeck coefficient, and they allow electrons to pass through them at different rates, one of the conductors will have the heated electrons move faster through it. Now, electric current, a flow of electrons, is generated in both conductors, and the one with faster electrons will have greater current.",
text8: "Because the two currents meet at the second junction, they will interfere destructively (they are both moving in opposite directions, so it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre subtracting from each other). However, they will not cancel out completely because one current is greater than the other, thus the net current is in the direction of the previously greater current.",
text9: "If both materials were the same, then their Seebeck coefficient will be the same, thus their currents will cancel out and there will be no electricity passing through the system. If the system is connected to an electrical circuit, direct current flows through that circuit. With enough caution and necessary equipment (two different conducting wires, source of heat, a voltmeter), you can try it at home!

This is extraordinary in a world depending on electricity; it shows how great inventions are based off simple principles, & how technology developed so fast to reach where it is now in a century & a half. So, how does the phonograph work?",
text3: "First, let‚Äôs understand its basic structure: a horn, a diaphragm (thin membrane) that can vibrate, a needle attached to the diaphragm, a cylinder wrapped in tin foil (what matters is not the material of the cylinder, but what it‚Äôs covered with), & a handle connected to a rotating rod with the cylinder in the center (the cylinder rotates when the handle is rotated).",
text4: "Recall the fact that sound consists of vibrations moving through a medium (like air), where each molecule in a medium bumps into another -& so on- to create a series of vibrations. To start off the series of bumps, we must produce sound. In the case of the phonograph, you talk to the horn. When you do so, a series of vibrations transmits through air until it hits the diaphragm at the end (horn=amplifier).",
text5: "Because the diaphragm is a thin membrane, the vibrations make it vibrate, which make the needle attached to it do so, too. To continue the process, the needle pointing at the foil on top of the cylinder makes grooves (holes) on the foil as it vibrates.",
text6: "This is where rotating the handle comes to work: as the cylinder rotates with the handle, the foil does so too, so a series of different shaped grooves are made on the foil with each different vibration; each groove shape corresponds to a certain sound.",
text7: "When you‚Äôre done talking, you put the cylinder back to its starting position, & reverse the direction in which you rotate the handle to play back the sound. Now that you are rotating it in the opposite direction, the different grooves in the foil vibrate the needle, vibrating the diaphragm, and thus vibrating the air in the horn, and finally, the sound comes back to your ears. This works because the same grooves that mimicked your voice in the recording part are now played back. Of course, the machine had low efficiency, but it was improved/altered with time. It‚Äôs simplicity yet originality is fascinating, is it not?",

After all, temperature is the measure of ‚Äòinternal‚Äô energy in a substance, or how active the atoms of a material are. The more active the atoms of a material, the more energy they have, & the higher that material‚Äôs temperature. This brings us to a conclusion: a coldest cold is when the atoms are at rest with no activity.",
text3: "The coldest cold temperature is referred to as absolute zero, or 0k (equivalent to -273.15Ÿí C), which if reached, that substance would theoretically have no volume and pressure (i.e it would take up no space). Although theoretically possible, absolute zero is nearly impossible to reach in real life because nothing can ever reach a point of no motion, & matter always takes up volume, even if minute. The closest scientists have ever been able to 0k is 0.006k. But, how was the coldest temperature determined? If interested, take a look at the photo at the end.",
text4: "What about the hottest hot? Although highly debated, it is mostly agreed upon that the hottest possible temperature is Planck‚Äôs temperature, the limit after which any hotter temperatures will break the laws of physics. Also, keep in mind that there are limits to how high energy can get in a substance, either by it reaching the highest speed possible (speed of light, which is impossible), or any other factor, which in turns limits its temp (according to the def. of temp.). Planck‚Äôs temp is about 1.42x10^32 K, or 1,420,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Celsius!!",

text2: "Let‚Äôs start with its definition: supercooling is the process of cooling a liquid to temperatures below its freezing point (point on the temp. scale where it freezes), but it doesn‚Äôt freeze. Confusing, isn‚Äôt it? In order to make sense of it, we need to understand how liquids freeze. For the sake of simplicity, let‚Äôs take water as an example. Water has a structure, and ice (freezed water) has a different one. For water to crystallize & turn into ice, something somehow has to initiate the change of structure and framing of the water.",
text3: "So, what initiates that change? There has to be something that ‚Äòpushes‚Äô the water into re-ordering its particles. Usually, that something is an impurity in the liquid (like a dust particle), which basically acts as a ‚Äòbarrier‚Äô between water molecules and allows them to re-order themselves (imagine it like a wall you accidentally bump into. It changes your regular course of motion, right? Or when a series of cars are on a line, and one car accidentally bumps another, then all others behind it bump into it too).",
text4: "But if the water is pure, it won‚Äôt re-order & freeze on its own, so it will stay in its liquid state even at temperatures below its freezing point (in the case of water, 0Ÿí C). This is where the trick lies: when (supercooling) cooling pure water below its freezing point, it won‚Äôt freeze unless you give it a push, like bumping it into a counter.",
text5: "We can simply demonstrate this by freezing a bottle of (pure) water in a freezer, then taking it out without shaking it. We can then either hit it with another surface or drop another object on it and watch the crystals magically form on their own and turn to ice, or we can pour the water onto a not-so-smooth surface and watch it create a mini ice mountain as it‚Äôs poured. Not all known water bottles work though, because many aren‚Äôt so pure. We can also try this using other liquids with different freezing points.",

text2: "A method used is called spectroscopy. Every element or compound has a specific ‚Äòid‚Äô that makes it differentiable from other elements or compounds. This ‚Äòid‚Äô is a unique set of wavelengths that only that element can absorb or emit. A dense gas, liquid, or solid can emit light of all wavelengths, or all colors, thus they have a ‚Äòcontinuous‚Äô spectrum. Thinner gases can emit only a specific range of wavelengths (colors) of light, depending on their element composition; that range is called emission line spectrum. Oppositely, when a light source is behind that thin gas, the gas can absorb some of that incoming light, or specific wavelengths of it; these wavelengths are called the absorption line spectrum.",
text3: "Observing either the light emitted by a gas or an incoming light that passes through that gas helps us determine what element that gas is composed of by determining the wavelength that is emitted or absorbed. To understand better, take a look at the pictures. But how can we ‚Äòobserve‚Äô the incoming light?",
text4: "A device called a spectroscope is used. Old spectroscopes use prisms as a means to divide the incoming light into its component wavelengths that are then focused by lenses and mirrors to be analyzed. Modern spectroscopes use diffraction gratings, or very small slits in a wall that allow light to diffract & split (similar to the function of a prism). The divided light doesn‚Äôt show all wavelengths, and not all the rainbow colors, but only some of them. If the incoming light was emitted by a gas, then these wavelengths and colors that show determine the elements that make up the gas. If the incoming light was from a continuous light source that then passed through and got ‚Äòabsorbed' by a gas, then these wavelengths that are missing, or that show black lines, determine the elements making up the gas.",
text5: "This method is most commonly used for stars, but it can be used for other gaseous celestial objects too. Keep in mind that the incoming light may pass through other objects and gases in space, other than those we want to know about, which alters the final set of wavelengths that reach the spectroscope. To solve the problem, these wavelengths can then be ‚Äòsubtracted‚Äô if we know the elements of those unwanted objects. Also, not only do the extra objects affect the incoming light, but so do pressure and temperature (they affect the amount of light). How and why do some elements absorb and emit specific wavelengths? How do prisms divide light? And what does temperature have to do with light? These questions will be answered at a different article.",

This technology uses ultrasonic frequencies in the same ways animals use echolocation. When ships send out a sound pulse, the wave goes through the water until it hits an obstacle, so some of it reflects back as an echo. A sonar system calculates the time from the moment the sound wave was sent until the receiver senses the reflected wave. Using the speed=distance/time equation, the distance of the obstacle can be calculated using the measured time and the sound speed.",

When temperature is increased, a material‚Äôs kinetic energy increases, thus the particles within the material move faster and vibrate (by definition). Because of these vibrations and collisions of particles, they tend to stay further apart from each other, expanding the material. When temperature decreases, the opposite happens: when it‚Äôs reduced, the particles attain lower kinetic energy, thus less movements and vibrations.

Fire alarms and other devices use a bimetallic strip, which is a trip consisting of two smaller strips above each other, each is a different metal. The different metals have different thermal expansion coefficients, so that when heated/cooled, they expand/shrink at different rates. But because the two metal strips are connected initially, principally they stay connected after expanding/shrinking. This creates a bend in the overall strip. Fire alarms make use of this bending by the heat from the fire to trigger the alarm.",

text2: "Logically, what would happen if we bring a piece of wood, for example, & cut it in half, then in half again, & so on? Will we continue infinitely? Ancient scientists thought the same. About 2500 years ago, Democritus believed that atoms are the smallest particles obtained after cutting a piece of matter so many times, but his idea was forgotten till the 1800‚Äôs, when scientist John Dalton proved they existed by experimenting on gases.",
text3: "He found that 2 gases can only react with whole number proportions, not with a random proportion. This means that gases consist of ‚Äòchunks‚Äô of tiny masses that are indivisible, proving atoms exist, & originating Dalton‚Äôs atomic theory. ‚ÄòBut are atoms the smallest particles possible?‚Äô Is a question that thrilled scientists afterwards, & J.J Thomson was among them.",
text4: "Thomson conducted experiments by putting two pieces of metal inside a vacuumed (air-less) tube, & coating the ends of the tube with a material that glows when hit by ‚Äòcharges‚Äô (as they were known at the time). After giving electricity to the metals in the tube, a glow is observed in it. Then, one positively charged metal & another negatively charged metal are put on opposite sides of the tube. If the ‚Äòglow‚Äô is negatively charged, it would bend towards the positive metal (opposite charges attract), but if it is positive, the opposite would happen. It turns out the glow bends towards the positive metal, proving that it is composed of negatively charged particles. After experimenting with different metals & getting the same result, Thomson concluded that these negative particles are the same in all elements, & because atoms compose all matter, the negatively charged particles (electrons), must be coming from the atoms themselves.",
text5:"Now that we went through the mindset of the geniuses who discovered the unobservable atoms & electrons, & we understand how we know they exist, it‚Äôs time to wonder again: how do we know the nucleus & protons exist?",

text2: "In the late 17th century, Newton formulated the Universal Law of Gravitation stating that any two masses attract each other with a force equal to F=GmM/R^2 (F: gravitational force, G: constant, m & M: mass of objects, R: distance between them). Let‚Äôs take you & Earth as an example of two masses, and the distance between you is Earth‚Äôs radius. Recall that the force between you & Earth is equal to F=mg (g: Earth‚Äôs gravitational acceleration), but it is also equal to F=GmM/R^2, as per Newton‚Äôs law, so we infer that g=GM/R^2.",
text3: "To measure Earth‚Äôs mass, we need to know the values of g, G, and R. g, or gravitational acceleration, can be obtained by experimentation, mainly dropping an object and measuring its initial height & the time it takes to reach the ground, then plugging them into an equation (h=0.5gt^2).",
text4:" R, radius of Earth, can be obtained by geometry. This ancient method involves measuring the angle the sun makes with the line perpendicular to Earth‚Äôs surface at two different -far- regions at the same time of day, then, using the angles measured and the distance between the two regions, the radius of Earth is calculated." ,
text5: "But what about G, the gravitational constant? Henry Cavendish, a scientist, performed an experiment in the late 18th century to find G. He suspended a rod connected to two similar spheres, then brought another pair of -bigger- spheres and put each big sphere beside a small one. As a result of the attraction force between each system of big and small spheres, the string holding the rod is twisted. By knowing the amount of twist, and the mass of each sphere, Cavendish was able to calculate the attracting force (using another physics concept). Now, from this formula F=GmM/R^2 , the only unknown, G, can be found by rearranging the formula (F: attracting force found, m, M: mass of small and big spheres respectively, & R: distance between small & big spheres).",
text6: "After finding G, we can find Earth‚Äôs mass M using g=GM/R^2, where it is the only unknown.To the next question: Does Earth's mass change?  If we're talking about changes like population growth and growing cities, for example, the answer is no. Earth's mass isn't affected by these factors because they occur from things already existing (i.e they're not created from nothing, but already present materials). However, it was found that Earth's mass is indeed affected by other factors, mainly the escape of gases from Earth (like H and He), which decreases the mass, and meteor impacts, which increase the mass. Overall, Earth's mass decreases yearly by about 0.000000000000001%, a very small number, so no need to worry :)." ,

text2: "Resonance is the answer. All materials have certain ‚Äònatural‚Äô frequency/ies that depend on several factors; when hit or struck with an oscillating force (think of a swing; oscillating: back and forth) of a frequency (how often that force is applied in a unit of time) equal to its natural frequency, a material tends to vibrate on a large scale and with high amplitudes. This is known as resonance. To understand it better, let‚Äôs tie it to an example: breaking a glass with a high-pitched scream.",
text3: "Remember those moments in cartoon films where a character ‚Äòscreams‚Äô that surrounding glass shatters? Sound is an example of an oscillating wave, and it can excite glass with its oscillations if the frequency of the sound wave matches that of the glass. When that happens, the glass ‚Äòtunes‚Äô to the sound vibrations and vibrates back and forth, shattering into pieces due to its inflexible nature.",
text4: "Resonance can be seen in almost infinite other situations in life, like radio. Each radio station has a different frequency that it uses to send out the radio we hear. In a car, the radio receiver can be tuned by the rider to different frequencies. These frequencies are created by electric circuits within the receiver (LC circuits, specifically; may be later discussed as it needs a topic of its own). When the receiver is tuned to have a frequency equal to that of a certain radio station, then a connection between them occurs that allows the rider to listen to that radio specifically. When the rider changes the receiver‚Äôs frequency, a connection with a different radio station takes place. The connection happens because when the two frequencies match, they posses an energy higher than that between any other surrounding frequency by the definition of resonance, making the rider hear only the radio from the high-energy -matching- frequency that surpasses others. Note that radio waves, those used in this example, have long wavelengths & can transmit energy across long distances, allowing us to hear them from afar.",
text5: "Other examples of resonance include string instruments, like guitars, or microwave ovens. But one shocking example is with industrial masses like buildings & bridges. During natural disasters like huge storms, strong winds cause the displacement of bridges, and in cases, winds may be strong enough to hit a bridge at its natural frequency. Once that happens, the bridge may vibrate so much as to cause its annihilation, as in the case of the Tacoma bridge accident in 1940. During earthquakes, on the contrary, the ground oscillates back and forth. If the frequency of that oscillation matches that of a building on top, then that building risks collapsing as it‚Äôs unbendable state will oscillate too.",

text3: "When an LC circuit is powered by a frequency equal to its natural frequency (visit the last article to learn more(, the current in the circuit alternates. In that circuit, there‚Äôs both: a coil, or ‚Äòinductance‚Äô; & a pair of 2 parallel metal plates that store electrons, or a ‚Äôcapacitor‚Äô. When the circuit is powered, the capacitor stores its electrical energy. The capacitor then unleashes the electrons & a current flows. When the current reaches the inductance, electrical energy is turned to magnetic energy as a magnetic field is generated. The magnetic field generated produces an opposing current to counteract that already in the coil. When the opposite current cancels with the original, the magnetic field is at its maximum. After that, the original current is retrieved as the reverse process ceases, & magnetic energy is turned back to electrical energy, allowing the current to return to the capacitor as the process repeats; at that moment, the magnetic field is at its minimum. As the cycle repeats, an alternating current (AC) is created in the circuit, allowing a changing magnetic field.",
text4: "How does this relate to wireless charging? Both a wireless charger & a compatible device have an LC circuit. When a changing magnetic field is generated in the charger‚Äôs circuit, it crosses the coil/inductance of the device‚Äôs circuit, & generates a current in it. And like magic, a device charges wirelessly!",

According to electromagnetism laws, when a current (electron flow) passes through a wire, a magnetic field is generated around it. Inversely, if a wire is in a magnetic field, a current is ‚Äòinduced‚Äô in it. When the wire is coiled or shaped into a total of ‚Äôn‚Äô loops, & again put it in a magnetic field, the result is ‚Äôn‚Äô times the power generated by a single loop."

text4: "With only gravity, you‚Äôll speed excessively. With simple calculations using equations of motion, it can be inferred that you reach about 1/3 the speed of light as you reach the center; but that‚Äôs only if you maintain the same acceleration of gravity you once had on the surface. Reality disproves this: the magnitude of gravity lessens as you approach earth‚Äôs center -where it‚Äôs 0. This is justified by Newton‚Äôs law of gravitation. In an alternative version of the law, gravity is proportional to the distance from Earth‚Äôs center. As you approach the center, gravity decreases. After reaching your maximum speed at the center of earth, gravity pulls you towards the center again, slowing you down.",
text5: "When you reach the opposite side, your speed reaches 0 -the same speed you had at the start- due to conservation of energy. Unless you hold tight to the rim of the hole, you will continue the round trip back to where you first dropped yourself as gravity continues to pull you inward.",
